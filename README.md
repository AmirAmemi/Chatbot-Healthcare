# ðŸ¤– Chatbot Healthcare

This repository contains the implementation of a **Healthcare Chatbot** designed to assist users in obtaining health-related information, schedule appointments, or answer common medical queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The chatbot aims to provide accurate, reliable, and efficient support for users seeking health advice.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The **Healthcare Chatbot** utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries and provides appropriate health-related responses. Some of the key features of this chatbot include:

- **Medical Information**: Provides general health advice, symptoms, and treatment options.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Helps users schedule medical appointments based on available times.
- **Symptom Checker**: Assists users in identifying potential conditions based on their symptoms.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes pre-trained models to understand user input and respond with appropriate information.

The chatbot can be integrated with various platforms (e.g., web, mobile apps) to assist users in healthcare-related queries.
